      "content": "What could be better than a delicious and fresh summer drink during these lovely and warm summer days?! When we found this gorgeous wild flower fields in the woods last week, we knew it would be the perfect spot for a cozy summer picnic. So we took our bikes for a quick bike tour and enjoyed some wonderful hours here. We teamed up with Belvedere Vodka again and used their pretty summer bottle edition for this Mango-Pineapple Summer Vodka drink. It’s super easy to make and basically tastes like summer in a glass! We used pineapple juice, mango juice, orange juice, passionfruit juice, a little bit of lemon, ginger syrup, Belvedere Vodka and a shot of whipping cream for the summer cocktail – super delicious! We also took some gluten-free bread, a little bit of cheese and some fruits to our picnic – a wonderful addition to the fruity drink. We hope you enjoy the recipe and happy Midsummer guys! Please drink responsibly.",

      "content": "One of our absolutely favorite things during winter is chai tea. It makes the cold winter months so much more cozy and always reminds us of lovely walks through the city while admiring all the beautiful christmas lights in town in December. Another favorite of ours are gluten-free waffles – we already have many gluten-free waffle recipes on the blog, because what could be more comforting than a warm waffle for breakfast, right? To combine those two favorites of ours we decided to make gluten-free waffles with a cherry compote and chai ice-cream. Such a delicious combination! We prepared the batter for the gluten-free waffles with the Kenwood Cooking Chef XL kitchen machine and also the cherry compote. What we love about the Cooking Chef XL is that it has an integrated scale, which makes it very easy to prepare batter and many other dishes. The cherry compote we cooked with the induction function of the Cooking Chef XL kitchen machine, which worked out so well. It’s super nice, that you can prepare so many different recipes with only one machine, we love it! We hope you enjoy our Christmas recipe during the holidays, we will make it again for sure.",

Now it’s really about time and we are excited to hear your feedback. In winter we made the dough with pumpkin, but since there was no pumpkin available in June we used sweet potato instead, which worked out so well! For the topping we used our favorite vegan spinach pesto, that we already shared with you in this post and all our favorite vegetables, like mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots, fennel and onions. We usually also put olives and artichoke hearts on top, but somehow couldn’t find them in the swedish countryside. Anyways this gluten-free vegan pizza is a true treat and you seriously don’t need cheese on top, even if you’re not vegan. We all loved it and it was such a pleasure to enjoy it in the dreamy garden of our dear friend Frida.",

Then take 150g of the baked sweet potato and purée together with the coconut milk. Blend gluten-free flour mix, active dry yeast, salt and spices in a mixing bowl. Add the sweet potato purée and olive oil (the purée should be warm, but not hot) and knead the dough for 2 minutes (use disposable gloves, if possible) – don´t knead too long, the dough should be still relatively sticky. Take a new mixing bowl (plastik, no metal!), brush the inside with a vegetable oil and leave the gluten-free yeast dough in the bowl for 1,5 hours on a warm spot to let the dough raise, covered with a damp kitchen towel. In the meantime prepare the vegan spinach pesto. Mix all ingredients in a blender. When the dough is raised, overturn it carefully on a big floured piece of baking paper, flour the top and the rolling pin as well and roll out the dough to a large circle (if you want to work accurate, you can draw a large circle with a pencil on the baking paper as orientation before and cut away the overlapping edges with a pizza cutter afterwards). Pull the gluten-free pizza dough together with the baking paper on a baking sheet and let raise for another 30-40 minutes, before you spread the vegan spinach pesto on top. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 250°C (500°F) top/bottom heat and cut the vegetables: cut the carrots into sticks, the mushrooms into slices, the red onions in quarters, the fennel into slices and the tomatoes into halves. After you spread the pesto, start topping with carrots, followed by the fennel, mushrooms, tomatoes and onions. Brush the mushrooms and onions with some vegetable oil. Then bake the gluten-free vegan pizza for about 30 minutes until crispy, then top with pumpkin seeds, seasalt, pepper and fresh thyme. Serve together with a few lemon quarters."

It’s not long anymore that we can have these delicious summer fruits this year, so making compotes is definitely a good way to enjoy them a few weeks longer. Of course you can also serve this breakfast warm during autumn and winter, maybe with a nice apple compote instead. When we photographed the goat milk rice it was actually quite a moody day and the garden was the perfect scenery for this little cozy set up. With our dear friends and neighbors Rahel, Lea and Anita and we enjoyed the goat milk rice with homemade compote and we all loved it. We hope you guys will enjoy it too!

If you serve the rice pudding in a glass, start with a layer of rice pudding, then a layer of compote and a few redcurrants, followed by a second layer of rice pudding and compote and a few coconut flakes and redcurrants for topping."
